# Backend for IdealAQ sensor data monitoring app
This app was completed as part of [Full-stack open](fullstackopen.com/en/) course. Additionally, the created solution aims to serve as a useful tool for [IdealAQ](https://idealaq.com/) project with a potential to be the base or a case study for future production version of the web app.

The app is used as a backend for data visualisation app ass well as for the third parties who need to pull data generated by scientific measurement devices into their own systems.

## Prerequisites
To run locally, listed commands require docker engine and docker-compose tool to be installed.

The app can be run directly on the host machine. See commands in appropriate `Dockerfile` for more details for Linux OS.

## Instructions
>**Note:** Instructions for querying data for third-parties are in the separate website: https://idealaq.github.io/cpcvis-data-docs/

> **Note:** The name of the container (app-backend) might not be the same. Verify using `docker container ls`.

To run the backend locally, run 
```bash
docker-compose -f ./docker-compose.dev.yml up
```
To open Swagger UI (for API documentation), visit http://127.0.0.1:8080/docs

To run tests, run while running backend in container: 
```bash
docker exec -it app-backend pytest .
```

To check linting, run while running backend in container:
```bash
docker exec -it app-backend flake8 .
```

## ENV Variables
> **WARNING:** The database used to run tests must be different from database used to run the app. Otherwise, all application data might ger corrupted or lost.
